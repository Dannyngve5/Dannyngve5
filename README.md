## ABOUT ME 👨🏻‍💻

I'm Daniel Parra, an undergraduate student majoring in Systems Engineering at the Francisco José de Caldas District University in Bogotá, Colombia. As I'm about to complete my degree, I'm excited about the endless possibilities that the world of technology and systems engineering has to offer. With a good academic record and a passion for all things tech, I've honed my skills in software development and problem-solving. I'm eager to continue learning, exploring new technologies, and contributing to exciting projects in the field. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate on interesting ventures!
